## Executive Summary

In recent decades, software development has prioritized modularity and economies of scale, enabling rapid and cost-effective implementation. However, this trend has often compromised **energy efficiency**.

As energy costs rise and renewable energy adoption accelerates, the importance of energy-efficient software processes, tools, and best practices has grown significantly. To address this, it is essential to:

- Identify software architecture and implementation tactics that improve energy efficiency.  
- Minimize negative impacts on application speed.  
- Incorporate energy efficiency during software architecture design.  
- Automate these practices using simple and transparent DevOps tools.  

By following these approaches, developers can consistently create software that is both **performant and energy-efficient**.
